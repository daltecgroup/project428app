  <!-- This path creates a wider, more rounded shoulder shape that connects well below the head. -->
  <!-- M 10 90: Starts the path at (10, 90), near the bottom-left corner of the viewBox. -->
  <!-- Q 50 55 90 90: Creates a quadratic Bezier curve. -->
  <!--   - (50, 55) is the control point, pulling the curve upwards to form the "neck" and shoulder peak. -->
  <!--     This point is chosen to connect smoothly with the bottom of the head circle. -->
  <!--   - (90, 90) is the end point of the curve, near the bottom-right corner. -->
  <!-- Z: Closes the path, drawing a straight line back to the starting point (10, 90) to complete the shape. -->
